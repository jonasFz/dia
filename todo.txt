* type sizes when generating assembly, right now everything is just a 4byte integer

* scopes. Variables declared in if blocks currently exist past the lifetime of their block

* loops

* arbitarty typed globals, (only functions at the moment)

* pointers and the operations needed to work with them

* string literals and type

* casting

* structs (big job)

* Multi file programs
