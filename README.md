# dia

Dia is a hobby language being developed to develop my c programming skills and to learn more about how compilers work.

Dia will be a low level language analogous to c. I ambitiously like to refer to it as "C without header files".

Currently I compile the source into an intermediate "bytecode" that I run through a very simple interpreter,
in the long run however I plan to make it compile down to x64 and run completely without any c runtime.
